# SolidRocketMotorDesign

- The file ProjectRock.ric is the OpenMotor File. It includes critical simulation values but not the entire simulation data.
### Open Motor Design:

- The pressure peaks at around 360 psi, which in N/m^2 is $5.516*10^6 N/{m}^2 $. The atmospheric pressure is $1.013*10^5 N/{m}^2$.
- This creates stress in longitudinal and hoop direction on the motor which the case has to withstand.
  - Hoop Stress is nearly twice as large as the longitudinal stress in all cylindrical pressure vessels.
